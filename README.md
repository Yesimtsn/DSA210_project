*My History with Youtube*

In this project i wanted to a have a better comprehension of my internet usage over the time. Analysis of our data can provide us a collective idea about the person we are,
what we like, our interests, life goals and even our private information. With the internet data we can interpret the cause and effect relationships, correlations of events 
and finally have a reliable conclusion. Thus, i wanted to use my Youtube data and see how my interests, my frequency of usage or my purpose of watching videos have changed. 

The dataset I'm going to use are the Google takeout and the Youtube API.
Google takeout of my Youtube data for my all watch and search history thus i can dive more deeply into my Youtube usage behaviour according to my age, interests at the times,
purpose of my Youtube usage and the average watch time in this long time capsule. It will be a good way to analyze my internet usage since Youtube is my most used application. 
Secondly the Youtube API for a better data fetching, more enhanced analysis of categories and the views of my watch history thus i can have a better view of my data and a better 
understanding of my data patterns.
