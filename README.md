**My History with Youtube**

In this project i wanted to a have a better comprehension of my internet usage over the time. Analysis of our data can provide us a collective idea about the person we are,
what we like, our interests, life goals and even our private information. With the internet data we can interpret the cause and effect relationships, correlations of events (such as the relation between years and my most watched categories) and finally have a reliable conclusion. Thus, i wanted to use my Youtube data and see how my interests, my frequency of usage or my purpose of watching videos have changed. 

The dataset I used are the Google takeout and the Youtube API:

1. Google Takeout Data: This includes my complete YouTube watch and search history, which allows for an in-depth exploration of my YouTube usage behavior over time. It will help identify patterns in interests, purpose of usage, and average watch time within this "time capsule" of data. 

2. YouTube API: This will provide additional insights, such as enhanced categorization and video details from my watch history, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the data and its patterns.

The goal was to fetch the data in the areas and to analyze the topics below. 
1. Interest Over Time: By analyzing the watch history and search history datasets, we can identify and track the categories that reflect my interests during specific periods. This provides insights into how my interests have evolved over time.
2. Purpose of Usage: This categorization provides a broader perspective by grouping specific interests into general themes. It helps identify the main reasons for using YouTube, such as learning (e.g., educational videos), entertainment (e.g., music, comedy, or gaming), or productivity (e.g., tutorials or how-tos). By analyzing these generalized categories, we can draw meaningful conclusions about overall patterns of YouTube usage.
3. Frequency of Usage: The watch time data will be analyzed on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis to understand usage patterns and identify trends over different time periods.


This project, My History with YouTube, explores how my digital behavior reflects my evolving interests, habits, and goals. I tried to visualize my data well and analyze them accordingly.
