*My History with Youtube*

In this project i wanted to a have a better comprehension of my internet usage over the time. Analysis of our data can provide us a collective idea about the person we are,
what we like, our interests, life goals and even our private information. With the internet data we can interpret the cause and effect relationships, correlations of events 
and finally have a reliable conclusion. Thus, i wanted to use my Youtube data and see how my interests, my frequency of usage or my purpose of watching videos have changed. 

The dataset I'm going to use are the Google takeout and the Youtube API.
Google takeout of my Youtube data for my all watch and search history thus i can dive more deeply into my Youtube usage behaviour according to my age, interests at the times,
purpose of my Youtube usage and the average watch time in this long time capsule. It will be a good way to analyze my internet usage since Youtube is my most used application. 
Secondly the Youtube API for a better data fetching, more enhanced analysis of categories and the views of my watch history thus i can have a better view of my data and a better 
understanding of my data patterns. 

//PROJECT IDEA: 

The goal of the project is to fetch the data in the areas that i want to analyze. 
1. Interest Over Time: The categories the watch history and search history dataset will determine set of interests that i have in the mean time.
2. Purpose of Usage: A more generalized version of the interests will give the conclusion of Youtube usage.
3. Frequency of Usage: The data of watch time will be analyzed in the daily, monthly and yearly basis. The results will be visualized in ... graphs. //Burda bunların yorumlanması

//PROJECT PLAN:

1. First i'm going to collect Youtube API and Google takeout data.
2. Then i will parse the important data such as category...?
3. I will make visulization of data that i collected.
4. After the visulization, i'm going to make correlations and give most likely explanations for the behaviours of my data.
5. Finally conclude the project with the most interested topics that i'm in, the most frequent times of my watch history and the ultimate goal of my Youtube usage. 

CONCLUSION?

**MY HISTORY WITH YOUTUBE**

In this project, I aim to gain a better understanding of my internet usage over time. Analyzing personal data can provide insights into who we are, what we like, our interests, life goals, and even private information. By interpreting internet data, we can uncover cause-and-effect relationships, identify correlations between events, and ultimately reach reliable conclusions.
For this project, I will focus on my YouTube data to explore how my interests, frequency of usage, and purposes for watching videos have evolved. YouTube, being my most-used application, offers an excellent lens through which to analyze my internet habits and preferences.

The datasets I will use are:

Google Takeout Data: This includes my complete YouTube watch and search history, which allows for an in-depth exploration of my YouTube usage behavior over time. It will help identify patterns in interests, purpose of usage, and average watch time within this "time capsule" of data.
YouTube API: This will provide additional insights, such as enhanced categorization, video details, and view counts from my watch history, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of the data and its patterns.

*PROJECT IDEA*

The goal of the project is to analyze the collected data and focus on the following areas:
1. Interest Over Time:
Using the watch history and search history datasets, I will identify and categorize my interests during different periods. This will reveal how my preferences have shifted over time.
2. Purpose of Usage:
By generalizing the identified interests, I will determine the primary purposes of my YouTube usage, such as entertainment, education, or professional development.
3. Frequency of Usage:
I will analyze watch time data on a daily, monthly, and yearly basis to uncover trends in my YouTube activity and pinpoint my most frequent times of usage.

The results will be visualized using various types of graphs and charts.
